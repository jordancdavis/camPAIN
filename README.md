CamPAIN is an application that aims to educate a user about the current 2016 presidential candidates and their 
views on current issues. The user is assigned or selects a candidate as his/her character to battle through a number 
of debates against the other candidates in order to win the election.

  The goal of the game is to get your candidate (either selected by the user or assigned through a compatability quiz) to win 5 
debates by answering question about your opponent. The more questions you get correct, the more your votes go up. In order to win
a debate the user must answer 3 out of 5 question correctly. Everytime a question is answered correctly you get a small period of 
time to fight with your opponent using the arrow keys and space bar. You must face yourself and the 4 other candidates in a battle 
of wits and win all 5 debates in order to become President. The games genre is classifed as a fighting trivia game.

administration account indicating a group id and password that the student will be able to join. The teacher can look up specific 
progress of each student in the given group and monitor their activity. 
  The student signs up for the game and gives the predetermined group id and password in order to be associated with the class.

their current progress and continue their game later. The teacher will also have this saved data to refer when needed.

  while trying to win the debate. 
  
  Dropout:
    The user has the option to drop out of the game at any time. Dropping out will remove their progress from the game, causing them
  to start over. A user might want to drop out of the debate if they don't like the candidate they chose (or the candidate that was
  chosen for them). A user might also drop out because they want to start over and get a better number of votes (cheaters). In either
  case the user has the option to give up.

election. Winning the election will give karma points to your candidate in the real world, allowing them to possibly get more votes 
while running for President of the United States!
